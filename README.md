# UFOs

## Overview

In this project, we create and design a webpage using Bootstrap. This objective of this webpage is to provide users a neat and organized table of a javascript data file. This file contains all sorts of data on multiple UFO sightings. We also enable the user to search for specific instances in the dataset by filtering the data based on specific parameters.

## Results

The webpage is a simple one with structured layout which contains different kinds of information. Starting from the top, there is a "UFO Sightings" button at the top left in the navigation bar. Pressing the button resets the filters and displays the raw table. Beneath that is the page header of the webpage: "The Truth Is Out There" with a background image. Underneath the backgroup image are two elements. On the left we have the title of a relevant article and on the right the article itself is displayed. Altogether the webpage looks as follows:

Below the article we have the dynamic table itself, powered by JavaScript. The filters for the table is located on the the left hand side of the table with multiple different text-boxes for user input. Simply pressing "Enter" or clicking on a different part of the page after typing something in the filter activates it. On the right hand side the table of UFO sightings data is displayed. Here is how the unfiltered table looks like:

As mentioned earlier, users can use one or multiple-criteria for the filters to find the information they seek. An example of a multiple-criteria filtration is displayed below:

## Summary

In summary, this is a webpage that contains a table of multiple entries on UFO sightings. Although the webpage works well and looks nice, a drawback of the design is that the final webpage doesn't contain a button for the users to press. With the absence of a button, instructions may need to be provided to users so that they know how to use the filters.

Two recommendations for further development of the webpage are as follows:

1. Add more data entries to the dataset. The filter system of the data can be improved on to be more user friendly.

2. When the raw sightings table is displayed, it displays all the content and becomes very long. Shortening the table and using a slider to slide through the table in the raw form could make the webpage look and feel better.
